            From the moment our paths crossed,<br>
            You've been my north star, bright and clear.<br>
            In your light, all my shadows are lost,<br>
            With you, my love, I have nothing to fear.<br><br>

            Your laughter, a melody so sweet,<br>
            It's the heartbeat to my soul's song.<br>
            Every day with you is a treat,<br>
            In your arms, is where I belong.<br><br>

            Signed,<br>
            Prince Chafah Sani
